## About

<p>Quite an old and popular game of tennis. I decided to implement this game through the console. The game has 3 modes - single, duel against a bot and duel against a player (on the same keyboard). In addition to this, the game has a start menu where you can enter your names. The game has a special mechanic that bounces off the player to make the game more varied. In single player mode I managed to get 19, input lag!!!</p>

## Installation

(if you have C# installed)
1. go to bin/Debug
2. downlaod and run tennis.exe
   
<p>Don't forget to configure your console correctly!<br/>Personally, I used the exact 8x9 font (if you have the same ratios, then choose them!)</p>
